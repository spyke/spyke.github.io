{"name":"spyke","tagline":"A Python package for visualizing, navigating, and spike sorting extracellular waveform data","body":"![spyke logo](http://spyke.github.com/images/logo.png)\r\n\r\nThe latest version of spyke will be made available in its own [GitHub repository](http://github.com/spyke) upon acceptance of a submitted paper. Until then, an old version is available [here](http://swindale.ecc.ubc.ca/spyke).\r\n\r\nFrom the current README:\r\n***\r\nSpyke currently works with [Swindale Lab](http://swindale.ecc.ubc.ca) `.srf` files. Some of its functionality was inherited from Tim Blanche's Delphi program \"SurfBawd\".\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\nspyke requires recent versions of the following to be installed:\r\n\r\n* [Python](http://python.org) (2.7.x, 3.x hasn't been tested)\r\n* [IPython](http://ipython.org) 1.0.dev\r\n* [numpy](http://numpy.org)\r\n* [scipy](http://scipy.org)\r\n* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)\r\n* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt)\r\n  ([PySide](http://pyside.org) will probably work too, but is untested)\r\n* [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/)\r\n* [Cython](http://cython.org)\r\n\r\nspyke is developed in Xubuntu 12.10. It should work in other Linux distributions.\r\nIn principle, it should also work in Windows and OSX.\r\n\r\nAn older version is described in the paper [Python for large-scale electrophysiology](http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/10.3389/neuro.11.009.2008/abstract).\r\n\r\nTo run:\r\n```\r\n$ python main.py # in the spyke folder\r\n```\r\nTo install for use as a library:\r\n```\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\nTo develop:\r\n```\r\n$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace\r\n```\r\nMany keyboard shortcuts are available. Tooltips give some hints. You can also\r\ndiscover them by searching for `keyPressEvent` methods in the code.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
